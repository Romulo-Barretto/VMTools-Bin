# VMTools-Bin
 Yet Just  Another  VMTolls Project

 This project intends to automate customization for the gnome Ubuntu user interface. These tools prepare a bunch of scripts for the customization. In this bunch of scripts, you can select one kind of pre-defined profile of the ones available. For example, you may select WKS_DevOps, WKS_TechContentEditor, WKS_Studio, WKS_QEmu, WKS_AddIns_Fonts, WKS_AddIns_FlatPackBrowser, WKS_AddIns_RepoBrowser and so on.

 This project is intended to create some virtual machines. We are provided one base script with a specific purpose. The base script prepares the base profile that may be used for common os experiences with same base customizations like screen, options, themes, and fonts.
